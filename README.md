# SerialCommunicationApp
..
Overview:
The Serial Communication App is a Windows 
Presentation Foundation (WPF) application built on 
the .NET Framework 4.8. Its primary purpose is to 
facilitate serial communication between a 
computer and external devices through COM ports. 
This documentation aims to guide users, 
developers, and contributors through the 
application's features, usage, and customization.

Features:

• COM Port Selection:

The application dynamically detects available 
COM ports and populates the dropdown menu 
accordingly.
Users can manually enter the baud rate for the 
selected COM port.

• Connectivity:

The "Connect" button establishes a connection to 
the selected COM port with the specified baud 
rate.
If a connection is successful, a confirmation 
message is displayed.

• Hexadecimal Message Handling:

Users can send and receive hexadecimal 
messages in real-time.
Sent and received messages are displayed in their 
respective textboxes.
The app processes user-entered messages as 
hexadecimal.

• Error Handling:

Proper error handling is implemented for scenarios 
such as unavailable COM ports, invalid baud rates, 
or failed message transmissions.
Error messages are displayed to users for better 
troubleshooting.

• Clear Functionality:

The "Clear" button resets the content of the 
"Received Messages" Text Box.

• Real-Time Display:

The "Received Messages" Text Box is updated in 
real-time as new messages arrive

Architecture:

The Serial Communication App follows a standard WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) architecture, utilizing 
the MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel) pattern. This pattern helps separate concerns and improve the 
maintainability of the application.

Components:

1.View (MainWindow.xaml):
• Defines the user interface elements using XAML.
• Responsible for presenting data to the user.

2.ViewModel (MainWindow.xaml.cs):
• Contains the application's logic and state.
• Communicates between the View and the Model.
• Handles user interactions, events, and data binding.

3.Model (SerialPort, ObservableCollection):
• Manages the underlying data and business logic.
• Handles serial port communication (reading, writing).
• Maintains the collection of received messages.

Usage:

• Connecting to a COM Port:
1. Open the application.
2. Choose the desired COM port from the dropdown menu.
3. Enter the baud rate in the corresponding textbox.
4. Click the "Connect" button.

• Sending Hexadecimal Messages:
1. Enter the hexadecimal message in the "Send" Text Box.
2. Click the "Send" button to transmit the message.

Real-Time Display:

The "Received Messages" Text Box displays both sent and received messages in real-time.

Conclusion:

The Serial Communication App adopts a simple yet effective architecture, leveraging the strengths of WPF and 
MVVM. It separates concerns, making the codebase modular and maintainable. The code structure aligns with the 
standard practices of WPF application development
